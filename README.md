# Power BI Learning Projects

This repository includes two Power BI projects "Amazon Prime Dashboard" and "Survey on Jobs "created during my learning phase.  
Through these projects, I learned how to clean and transform data, build interactive dashboards, and use DAX for calculated metrics.  
I also gained hands-on experience in data visualization and improving report design for better insights.  
These projects helped strengthen my foundational skills in Power BI and business intelligence.
